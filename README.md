Technical Problem: Copy ‘block.xyz’

Task: Create a responsive web page that replicates the homepage of the website block.xyz.

Requirements:

1. HTML Structure:
● Recreate the basic HTML structure of the block.xyz homepage.
● Include all sections such as the header, navigation menu, main content
areas, and footer.
● Ensure to include placeholders for any interactive elements (e.g., buttons,
forms).

2. CSS Styling:
● Use CSS to closely match the styling of block.xyz.
● Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and
mobile devices.
● Use Flexbox or Grid for the layout.
● Apply styles to match the fonts, colors, spacing, and other visual elements
as closely as possible.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
● Use vanilla JavaScript (or optionally a framework like React, Vue.js, or
Angular) to implement any interactive elements found on the block.xyz
homepage.
● Ensure that any buttons, forms, or dynamic content behave similarly to the
original site.

4. API Integration (if applicable):
● If the block.xyz homepage includes dynamic data fetched from an API,
replicate this functionality using a mock API or a similar public API.
● Ensure that the data is displayed and updated correctly.

5. Additional Features (Optional):
● Implement smooth scrolling for any anchor links.
● Add a loading indicator for dynamic content.
● Provide detailed comments in the code to explain the implementation.

● Accuracy in replicating the block.xyz homepage.
● Code quality and structure.
● Responsiveness and styling.
● Correctness and efficiency of the implemented functionality.
● Additional features implemented (if any).
